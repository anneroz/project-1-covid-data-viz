# Covid-19 Vaccination Timeline Data Visualization

### Context:
* I am presenting a comparison on the relationship between vaccinations and deaths.

### User and Organisational Goals:
* User: To allow users to learn about the advantages of vaccination, and prompt them to register for vaccination.
* Organisation: To educate users who are hesitant about vaccination.

### Project URL
* https://eloquent-cori-638199.netlify.app/

### Why the Project Should Exist
* The project should exist to address vaccine hesitancy.

### UX/UI:
* User story: As a user, I am afraid to register for the Covid-19 vaccination due to claims of people dying after taking the vaccination. I want to garner more information about the actual statistics of deaths from the disease, since the time the vaccinations have been rolled out. I can search for different countries, and compare the number of vaccinations that have been administered, versus the historical count for the deaths from covid-19. If I can visually see that an increasing number of vaccinations results in a flattening of the death cases, I can make a more informed decision about whether or not to get myself vaccinated.
* Wireframes:

</div>



Target audience:
1. Otter lovers
2. Nature lovers

We use the `<div class="container">` to create a Bootstrap container

Here is how we can include a responsive image in Bootstrap:

```
<img src='otters.jpg' class='img-fluid'>
