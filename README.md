## A project about otters in Singapore
### By Vivien

Purpose of my website:
* Showcase cute otters
* Inform the public

Target audience:
1. Otter lovers
2. Nature lovers

We use the `<div class="container">` to create a Bootstrap container

Here is how we can include a responsive image in Bootstrap:

```
<img src='otters.jpg' class='img-fluid'>
```
